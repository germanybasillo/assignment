            <h1>About the Philippine Navy</h1>
            <p class="content">The Philippine Navy (PN) (Filipino: Hukbong Dagat ng Pilipinas) is
                the naval warfare service branch of the Armed Forces of the
                Philippines. It has an estimated strength of 24,500 active service
                personnel, including the 10,300-strong Philippine Marine Corps. It
                operates 82 combat vessels, 14 auxiliary vessels, 25 manned aircraft
                and 8 unmanned aerial vehicles. Tracing its roots from the Philippine
                Revolutionary Navy on May 20, 1898, while its modern foundations
                were created during the creation of the Offshore Patrol in February
                9, 1939, the PN is currently responsible for naval warfare operations
                and maritime patrol missions within the Philippine Waters, as well as
                ensuring the protection of the Philippine&#39;s maritime interests,
                including the West Philippine Sea and Benham Rise.</p>
                <h2>History:</h2>
                <p>The Philippine Navy traces its roots back to the Philippine
                    Revolutionary Navy, established on May 20, 1898.</p>

        <h1>Ranking</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The current Philippine military ranks are inspired partially by the very
first military insignia used by the military forces during the Philippine
Revolution of 1896 and the Philippine–American War, and the
insignia used by the Philippine Constabulary raised in 1902 during
the final days of the Philippine–American War, which was basically
the same style of insignia used by the United States Army at that
time. Elements of both the US army ranks and the old Philippine Army appear in the current ranks;</p>
